## Name

The 'little boxes' in [Malvina Reynolds' famous song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_2lGkEU4Xs) are all made of ticky-tacky, and they all look just the same. Here we provide an open-source toolkit for reproducing and extending carbon box models for radiocarbon analysis, and we expect they will be as interchangeable as Malvina Reynolds' boxes!
